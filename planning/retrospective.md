## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- I have successfully created a portfolio page and decorated it with a nice design.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- I couldn't fully adapt the navigation bar to the phone screen size due
  to my lack of knowledge of JavaScript.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- My design was originally without a `My Projects` section, but I created one
- My plans didn't include gradients in the background of some of the secs,
  but I added them because it looks nice.

### Or remove extra steps?

- NA
